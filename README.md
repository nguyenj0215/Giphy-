# Giphy-
This is a page created as a way of learning how to work with apis using the jquery ajax request. Upon clicking of one of the buttons labeled with one of the NFL teams name, 10 gifs will be generated. These gifs will be displayed on the page along with its title, and rating. A user can click on the still image to initiate the gif and click once again to pause the gif. In addition, custom buttons can be added by typing in the text box provided and clicking on the submit button. Clicking this cusom button will have the same functionality as the preloaded buttons.
